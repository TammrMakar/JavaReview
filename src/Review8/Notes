Overriding- process when same method exist in super and subclass
why-to provide flexibility
how to implement
1-inheritance
2-same signature (name+parameters)
3-same return type
4-access modifiers-> overriding method must have same level of visibility or higher

final - keyword that identifies something is completed and no modification can be done

final can be used with:
variables - makes variable CONSTANT
methods - cannot override it
class - cannot be inherited

Abstraction - process of hiding implementation details and  showing only functionality
Why- reduce complexity,improve maintainability and security

How to implement abstraction?
by using Abstract classes - we can achieve 0 to 100% abstraction
by using interfaces - we can acheive 0 to 100% abstraction (before java 8 it was only 100%
